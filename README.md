# guppyManager
guppyManager helps breeders to maintain their breeding stock

It is my first application in Java. Written to reduce amount of doc files on my hdd. Hopes it will in future helps me in keeping records about lines and strains of guppies that I currently breed.
If it works out nicely will add functionality for other species of fish as well as leopard geckos. I hope that other breeders will find it useful once it is done.

As for 18.10.2016
It uses spring security, wro4j and spring Boot.
